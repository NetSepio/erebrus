# Erebrus

Erebrus, a decentralized VPN, that ensures your privacy, security, and transparent data practices. It's open-source, ensuring no hidden data tracking or logging. Complementing it, our DePIN initiative lets anyone worldwide participate as a node, contributing either physical servers or virtual machines and earning incentives. With this, we pave the way for safer, decentralized Wi-Fi hotspots, making unreliable public Wi-Fi a thing of the past.
